this outlines some issues with fileschanged
and some other things that need doing.

------

fileschanged ignoring certain fam codes...
I'm ignoring exists and endexists.  should I be?
I'm doing my own accounting of files I'm monitoring.

----------
problem with monitoring a file that gets written to so repeatedly
that it doesn't ever get through the FAMPending loop.
eg) fileschanged --recursive --files-to-monitor /tmp/this > /tmp/this/list
need a way to detect very frequently changing files and then cancel monitoring of them.  eg) so frequently that the program can't operate.
**this problem seems to have just "gone away"***

--------------------

calmly handle binary filelists.
keep track of number of files attempted to be monitored
versuses number of files monitored.
when this rate is high enough, show a warning.
