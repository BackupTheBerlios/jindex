%description
@PACKAGE_NAME@ is a GNU/Linux command-line utility that reports when files have been altered. 
This software is a client to the FAM (File Alteration Monitor) server that is now available in some distributions.  Here's how the fileschanged FAM client works: you give it some filenames on the command line and then it monitors those files for changes.  When it discovers that a file has changed (or has been altered), it displays the filename on the standard-output.
