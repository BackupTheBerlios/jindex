fileschanged.

(from the info manual)

The fileschanged utility is a FAM (File Alteration Monitor) client.  From 
the command-line it monitors sets of files and shows you when they change.  
You can use fileschanged in shell scripts to take action when monitored 
files become altered.  In it's simplest form, you can give fileschanged 
filenames to monitor from stdin, and it will report when those files have 
changed via stdout.  You can stop fileschanged from monitoring files by 
pressing CTRL-C.  In a more complex usage, fileschanged can monitor 
command-line specified files recursively, while following symbolic links, 
while staying on the current filesystem, and reporting deleted files as 
well as created and changed files that haven't been written to for 2 
seconds.  This software is protected by the GNU General Public License, so
users are free to share and change it.


notes to my future self on how to build packages:

to build a debian package:
	make sure you have cdbs installed.
	make dist
	cp fileschanged-{version}.tar.gz /tmp
	cd /tmp
	tar -zxvf fileschanged-{version}
	cd into the top level source directory.
	debuild

to build a redhat package:
	make sure you have rpmbuild installed.
	make dist
	mkdir ~/play/rpmbuild/SOURCES/fileschanged-{version}
	cp fileschanged-{version}.tar.gz ~/play/rpmbuild/SOURCES/fileschanged-{version}
	cd into the top level source directory
	./configure
	rpmbuild -ba --sign redhat/fileschanged.spec
